# unsupervised-learning-algo-experiments
 I experiment with 5 unsupervised ML algorithms on two datasets

KMeans, Gaussian Mixture Model for clustering.

PCA, ICA and UMAP for dimensionality reduction/feature selection

datasets(included): 
- Adult dataset (1994 US Census data) 
- Bank Marketing data (customer data with a target variable that indicates if they subscribed to a term deposit)
