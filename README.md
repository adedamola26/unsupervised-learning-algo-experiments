# unsupervised-learning-algo-experiments
 I experiment with 5 unsupervised ML algorithms on two datasets

KMeans, Gaussian Mixture Model for clustering.

PCA, ICA and UMAP for dimensionality reduction/feature selection

datasets(included): 
- Adult dataset (1994 US Census data) 
- Bank Marketing data (customer data with a target variable that indicates if they subscribed to a term deposit)

Here's the [report](https://github.com/adedamola26/unsupervised-learning-algo-experiments/blob/main/project%20report.pdf), [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/adedamola26/unsupervised-learning-algo-experiments/blob/main/unsupervised.ipynb), [adult dataset](https://github.com/adedamola26/unsupervised-learning-algo-experiments/blob/main/adult.csv) and [bank dataset](https://github.com/adedamola26/unsupervised-learning-algo-experiments/blob/main/bank.csv).
